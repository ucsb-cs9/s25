# Instructions

- Homework assignments will be done online in the Gradescope system: [{{ site.gradescope_url }}]({{ site.gradescope_url }}).
- Please pay close attention to the instructions, especially when asking to provide the answer
  - Many questions are autograded by the system, which does a character-by-character comparison of the correct answer and your submitted answer.
  - Please be **PRECISE** and **EXACT** in your solutions in this case, otherwise your answer will not be considered correct.
- You may save your work at any time before the deadline (and I highly encourage this!). You may also resubmit your work any time before the deadline. We will only grade your latest submission.

Complete and submit your answers on Gradescope for **H02** based on the textbook reading.

Reading is from Chapters 1.4.6, 2.1 - 2.2.1 of the physical book or [Chapters 1.13, 3.1 - 3.3 of the electronic version](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/index.html).

If you run into any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to post on the forum.
