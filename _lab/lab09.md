This lab is based on the chapter ["Search Tree Implementation"](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/Trees/SearchTreeImplementation.html).
We recommend drawing out the different cases and methodically testing them to verify that your code is correctly handling all relevant deletions.

In this lab, you'll have the opportunity to practice:

* Defining classes in Python
* Implementing and applying the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure
* Writing functions to delete nodes from BST
* Testing your functionality with pytest

**Note: In this lab, you need to fill-in the provided template and implement the assertions that cover all cases.** _Pay attention to the guidelines regarding the **MISSING CASE**._

Please read the lab in its entirety first, before starting on your implementation.


# Introduction

The goal for this lab is to write a program that will manage events/holidays for a business. Each node will store a `date` as a string attribute (key) and the `eventinfo` containing the event name as the corresponding value (payload).

You will also need to write pytests in `testFile.py` verifying that your code works correctly. This lab writeup will provide some test cases for clarity, but the Gradescope autograder will run different tests than what is shown here.

_Use the visualization functions provided at the end of the writeup to help debug what the code is doing at every step._



## Cybersecurity Applications

The Binary Search Tree skills you're developing in this lab have direct applications in cybersecurity.
BSTs are frequently used in intrusion detection systems to efficiently organize and search through network events by timestamp - similar to how we're managing event dates in this lab.
When security analysts need to investigate incidents, they must quickly search through massive logs of chronologically-ordered events, and BST-based data structures enable this rapid lookup.
Additionally, BSTs are used in packet filtering for firewalls, where rules can be organized hierarchically for efficient matching.

The node deletion techniques you're implementing are particularly important, as security systems must frequently update their data structures when threats are neutralized or rules change. For further reading on data structures in cybersecurity, check out [NIST's guidelines on efficient security monitoring](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/92/final).

# Instructions

You will need to create the following files:
* `EventNode.py` - Defines a BST Node class that includes fields for a BST node that stores event data.
* `EventTree.py` - Defines an EventTree (BST) class that is an ordered collection of a set of events (ordered by date).
* `testFile.py` - This file should contain your pytest functions that tests the overall correctness of your class definitions.

We provided starter code for you below. However, **one of the needed sub-cases for the BST deletion is missing**; once you complete the provided code and test it, you need to **find a test case that will identify the missing section of the code.**
- IMPORTANT: even if the autograder gives you full credit, you will miss out on the 8% of this lab grade (manually-graded portion) if you do not identify the test case that reveals the missing code section.
- You need to add the corresponding code to make this _correctly-formed assertion_ pass (the code provided here should be failing).

You should organize your lab work in its own directory. This way all files for a lab are located in a single folder. Also, this will be easy to import various files into your code using the `import / from` technique shown in lecture.

# testFile.py

This file should test all of your classes and required methods using pytest. Think of various scenarios and edge cases when testing your code according to the given descriptions. You should test every class' method functionality. Even though Gradescope will not use this file when running automated tests (there are separate tests defined for this), it is important to provide this file with various test cases (testing is important!!).

**Hint: use the traversal methods (inorder, preorder and/or postorder) to test different tree structures.**

As mentioned above, you need to **find a test case that will identify the missing section of the code.**
- IMPORTANT: even if the autograder gives you full credit, you will miss out on the 8% of this lab grade (manually-graded portion) if you do not identify the test case that reveals the missing code section.
- Add this test case's assertion into your test file and add a comment `### MISSING CASE ###` to identify it.
- You need to add the corresponding code to make this _correctly-formed assertion_ pass (the code provided here should be failing). Make sure that you have the `### MISSING CASE ###` comment in the implementation code to identify the originally-missing portion of the code that handles this test case.


## Applications Across Disciplines

The ordered data management skills you're learning extend far beyond computer science. In economics, BSTs help implement efficient algorithms for financial market trading systems, where transaction events must be processed in order by time and price.
- Biologists use similar tree structures to organize taxonomic classifications and analyze evolutionary relationships.
- Chemists utilize these data structures when managing experimental data organized by molecular weights or reaction times.
- Mathematicians apply BSTs in computational geometry for point location problems.
- Even sociologists benefit from these structures when analyzing temporal social network data or organizing demographic information.

The core skill of efficiently managing ordered data with insert, lookup, and delete operations is fundamental across disciplines that deal with hierarchical or time-series data.

For more on BSTs in scientific computing, you can about the [use of tree structures for processing files](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/357980.357987) or read this recent article on [An Experimental Comparison of Tree-data Structures for Connectivity Queries on Fully-dynamic Undirected Graphs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3709660).
